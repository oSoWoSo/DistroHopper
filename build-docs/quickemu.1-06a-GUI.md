### Quickgui

While `quickemu` and `quickget` are designed for the terminal, a
graphical user interface is also available:

To install Quickgui on Ubuntu:

``` shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannick-mauray/quickgui
sudo apt update

### qqX

There is also a multi option desktop integrated text
interface, the **quickemu quickget X terminal project**, or **qqX**,
with lots of unique tools and utilities to help you make
light work of installations, snapshots and disk management
